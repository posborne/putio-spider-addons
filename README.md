Introduction
------------

This respository code for both a Firefox add-on and Chrome extension
for scraping web pages for links that can be added to Put.io.
Controls are provided to users in order to allow for the links on
the page to be filtered.

Instances in which this could be useful are left as an exercise for
the user.

Installation
------------

At this time, these extensions are not on the Chrome/Firefox add-on
stores.  To install, you will need to build from source.  Please refer
